Learning DevOps is important because it integrates development and operations, 
allowing teams to collaborate more effectively and deliver software faster. 
It automates processes like continuous integration and deployment, 
ensuring smoother releases and higher code quality. 
DevOps also helps teams make informed decisions about software architecture 
and supports scalability through cloud services, making the development process more efficient and reliable.
