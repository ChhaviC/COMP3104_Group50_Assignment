George Brown College is one of the top colleges in Canada. It is consistently ranked highly in national rankings.
George Brown College provides a blend of theory and hands-on learning, as well as applied research, entrepreneurship and social innovation opportunities.
The college is named after George Brown (1818-1880) who was a Canadian politician, founder of The Globe newspaper in Toronto (now the national newspaper The Globe and Mail), and one of one of Canada's "Fathers of Confederation".
I feel honored to study around so many talented people and be able to learn highly intresting topics from them.
